That’s a *great* idea! Not only will you help him, but you’ll also build something that can help a much wider audience *and* grow your brand in the process.

If you're thinking of a YouTube series, here are a few steps to get you going:

---

### 🔥 **Series Concept**:
**Title Idea**: *“Hands-On Data Analysis from Scratch”* or *“Data Analysis Lab: Learn by Doing”*

**Target Audience**: Beginners or intermediate learners who want practical, project-based learning.

---

### 🧩 **Episode Structure Idea**:

1. **Intro to Data Analysis**  
   - What it is, what tools you'll use (e.g., Python, Pandas, Excel, etc.), and what they’ll learn.

2. **Setting Up the Environment**  
   - Installing Python, Jupyter Notebook, VS Code, or using Google Colab.
   - Brief walkthrough on how to set up datasets.

3. **Working with Real Data** (each of these could be one or more episodes):
   - Importing and cleaning a dataset.
   - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA).
   - Visualizations using Matplotlib / Seaborn / Plotly.
   - Asking real questions and finding answers using data.
   - Mini-projects (e.g., “Let’s analyze Netflix data,” “Sales data trends,” etc.)

4. **Capstone Project**  
   - Combine everything into a full analysis project.
   - Walkthrough + how to present results.

---

### 🛠 Tools to Feature:
- **Python + Pandas**
- **Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab**
- **Excel (for beginners or comparisons)**
- **Matplotlib / Seaborn**
- Maybe even **SQL** in a later episode

---

### 📢 Extras:
- Offer downloadable datasets & notebooks.
- Include a GitHub link for all code.
- Make short clips for social media with quick tips or “data hacks.”
